There is a file for each of the sorting algorithm.
We use another file compare_sorts.py to dynamically generate inputs and pass to each sorting algorithm file, which then plots the results returned by each sorting algorithm.

ONLY 1 FILE TO EXECUTE-
Execute compare_sorts.py to obtain the final plotting of the execution.
